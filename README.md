# 🧮 Shape Management System

This is a Java-based console application to manage and validate different geometric shapes using object-oriented principles like inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Supports **Triangle**, **Pentagon**, and **Hexagon**
- ✅ Validates input values based on **unit** (cm or inches)
- ✅ Calculates **area** for each shape
- ✅ Uses **Outline** class to manage thickness, color, and style of borders
- ✅ Fully modular with **validation classes** for each shape
- ✅ CLI-based menu system
